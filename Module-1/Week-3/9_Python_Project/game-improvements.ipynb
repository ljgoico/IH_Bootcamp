    "## MEJORAS:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - He cambiado los nombres de las habitaciones a colores en lugar de números y he hecho que el output se viera en el color de current room.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Cuando entra en una habitación, directamente explora lo que hay y te pregunta qué quieres examinar.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Si lo que examina no es una puerta, te vuelve a preguntar qué quieres examinar sin volverte a decir en qué habitación estás y sin volverla a explorar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## COSAS POR MEJORAR:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Poner alguna cosa en \"bold\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Mejorar la separación entre párrafos para que la lectura sea más fácil.\n",
    "\n",
    "## APRENDIZAJE:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Pseudo-code is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NOTA PARTICULAR:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - He pasado de pensar que nunca hubiera sabido cómo mejorar el código a entenderlo mucho mejor después de hacerme un esquema con colores, por lo que, aunque tarde, ha sido un alivio :D"
